                            <p>A successful business is one that is planned out extensively before it becomes anything of substance.</p>
 
							<p>What makes a blueprint better than a plan? A business plan only answers the question of "why" while a business blueprint answers the questions to both "why" and "when." When is a very important question to know the answer to because it can tell you where the company is going and how long it will take to get there.</p>
							 
							<p>Everyone enjoys having the answers written out for them. For example, if you were to take a test would you (a) study really hard and hope you know the answers to everything or (b) bring a bunch of notes that contain the answers to all of the questions. For me, I would choose (b) to bring the notes with all of the answers because come test time, I don't want to have to think, I just want to do.</p>
							 
							<p>Having a business blueprint that answers the questions to when, open up the doors to one of the most important aspects to the growth of a company, setting goals. Setting goals gives you something to work for. Yes, you have an end goal for the company, but odds are that goal is very far off in the distance. In order to stay focused, you must work towards goals, otherwise it is easy to lose motivation and quit.</p>
							 
							<p>Your business blueprint should be fluid in nature. It should be able to adapt to new obstacles without skipping a beat.</p>
							 
							<p>Nonetheless, in some cases it is impossible to predict a certain event in your company's history. At this point, your blueprint must change. You must change your blueprint to take into account the new variables in the equation that makes up your company. A business blueprint is not set in stone. You made the blueprint, you can change it. You should change it!</p>
							 
							<p>No blueprint is perfect, but a well thought out and forever evolving blueprint will ultimately equate to a successful company.</p>
