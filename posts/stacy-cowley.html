                            <p>Ability is nothing without opportunity and opportunity only comes to those with a vast amount of connections.</p> 
 
							<p>Connections with other individuals is an extremely important aspect to the success of a company. People buy from people they trust. In order to form this trust, one must have a relationship with the other. Communicate with them, have a friendly discussion about your product. Establish your expertise because expertise is huge in the world of entrepreneurship.</p> </p> 
							 
							<p>Every year in Davos, Switzerland the World Economic Forum is held where many influential individuals are invited to form relationships and discuss any future ideas they may have. The World Economic Forum invites a select number of new startup companies of which they believe will have a substantial impact on the future. In doing this, the Forum gives startups the opportunity to form connections they wouldn't otherwise have the opportunity to form.</p> 
							 
							<p>The Forum is also a good place to test out ideas because the people there have been in the business for a while and know the market. One can run their ideas past them and see what they think because the opinions of these individuals are more than likely the right opinions to have. Also, one should try and get people excited about the prospects of their idea. Getting an affluent, influential individual excited about the idea will open doors one may have never had the opportunity to open.</p> 
							 
							<p>Although you might not have the opportunity to attend this Forum, the lesson still applies. Forming connections with resourceful individuals can give your company the extra push it needs to become successful.
